You are planning a Canadian personal finance submodule titled "${submodule}" under the module "${module}".

Task:
Return ONLY a valid JSON array of 6 to 10 sections â€” nothing else, no extra text, no markdown, no comments. Just the 6-10 unique sections. Once you have 10 sections, stop the json, no more sections.

Format:
[
  {
    "title": "Section Title",
    "summary": "1-2 sentence summary of the section",
    "wordCount": 1000
  },
  ...
]

Constraints:
- TOTAL word count should be above 10000 words across all sections combined but it should not exceed 12000 words across all sections combined
- Do NOT include more than 10 sections
- Do NOT repeat sections
- Do NOT include any explanation or text outside the JSON array
- Do NOT wrap the response in backticks or markdown
- The last section should complete the plan and conclude the submodule

Consider the following when picking the topics and the summaries:
- Canadian laws, currency, banking, and personal finance context
- Room for case studies, inline citations, and media placeholders

The sections should include the topic to include in: ${keywords.join(', ')}
Requirements: ${miscRequirements}
Audience: Canadian high school or university students

Write a detailed section titled "${section.title}" for the submodule "${submodule}" in Canadian personal finance.

Requirements:
- Audience: High school or university students in Canada
- Go slightly above the word count: ${section.wordCount}
- Use Canadian terminology, spelling, laws, and currency
- Include inline citations (e.g., from CRA, Government of Canada, Canadian banks, etc.) and then citations at the end in the form of links or specific references
- Add media placeholders, real-world Canadian case studies
- Have the writing have some energy that can speak to high school students well while also covering the full scope of information necessary - not super formal but still enough to be in a school textbook that conveys information in a mildy fun way. Don't be corny though please.
- Don't Hallucinate things you are unsure of - get good sources and search the web for specific facts. Avoid repetition of content and sentences as much as possible.
- Feel free to make tables and other things in Markdown that can really make things more impactful
- Have relevant case studies that students can relate to that also really hammer in and emphasize the information given. Make them long and relevant and really focus on the HOW more than the what. Focus on how they relate, the exact situations and don't repeat case studies.
- Avoid repetitive language.
- From time to time feel free to address the reader directly using language like "you" and other second person terms to deliver impact.
- Include 5 multiple choice questions (MCQs)
${includeMathQuestions ? '- Include math-based examples or calculations where appropriate' : ''}
- Section Summary: ${section.summary}

MARKDOWN FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use proper markdown syntax:
  * Use ## for section headings (level 2)
  * Use ### for subsection headings (level 3)
  * Leave blank lines between paragraphs
  * Use * or - for unordered lists
  * Use 1. 2. 3. for ordered lists
  * Use **bold** and *italic* for emphasis
  * Use > for block-quotes
  * Use proper markdown table syntax when needed
  * Format code snippets and examples properly
- Do NOT use HTML tags in your content, use only markdown
- Ensure sufficient spacing between different content sections
- Ensure the content is clear, easy to read, and well-structured
- Ensure the content is well-written and easy to understand
- Ensure the content is well-organized and easy to navigate
